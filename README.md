# CPP

This is my frirst CPP program.

It can dynamicly generate Mandelbrot set, using Pallete from Ultra Fractal and SFML2.0 library.

To navigate use left and right button on your mouse, to change number of iterations use "Q" and "W".

In order to compile it you will need all dlls from SFML2.0 library.
